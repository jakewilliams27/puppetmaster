# PuppetMaster Modloader & Toolkit
PuppetMaster is a modloader for TowerFall Ascension. It currently has very limited modding capabilities because I am very new to this type of development and learning how to implement modding properly has been a challenge.

## Features 
- Runtime resource patching ( Resource Pack Mods )
- New Commands

## Coming Soon
- Custom variants
- The ability to modify arrow properties through mods
- New award titles and constraints

## Installation
1. Download the latest release and unzip it somewhere
2. Run PuppetMasterInjector.exe and select your towerfall folder
3. Click inject and wait for the modloader to launch
4. To ensure the modloader has successfully injected, open the command window and type 'modloader_info', if the command works, install is successful!

## Known Issues
- Currently, does not work with TowerFall from Steam. I think the DRM breaks the injector. Also interferes with launching and grabbing the PID, but I have a working fallback for that.
